## NB Notes

-	See [Why font-size must NEVER be in pixels](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/font-size-px/)
	-	Never set these properties with fixed units like pixels:
		-	font-size
		-	line-height
		-	letter-spacing
	-	Doing so overrides the system and browser settings for these properties.
	-	For font-sizes stick to using REMs.
	-	For line-height stick to using unit-less values like 1.5 (line-height-in-px / font-size-in-px = line-height, ex 24px/16px = 1.5).
	-	For letter-spacing stick to using EMs.
	-	Calculate the REM from PX by dividing the give PX value by 16.

## Overview

### To Do

-   [ ] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   [ ] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
-   [x] **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content
-	[ ] Width/height:
	-   [ ] Be careful when using fixed widths or heights. Give preference to min/max width/height. (I again used height instead of min-height on the main container. This causes issues when the content starts getting bigger. NOTE TO SELF!)
	-	[x] When specifying fixed or min/max sizing, give preference to relative units.
	-	[x] Use dvh instead of vh.
	-	[x] Do not set full width (100vw) because it is not necessary.
	-	[x] If you want it to take up all the remaining space of the container (vertically), set it to flex with column direction and flex-grow: 1.
-	[x] Fonts:
	-	[x] Figure out, if the design specifies a font-size, where this should be set.
	-	[x] Font-family import in HTML and not in CSS import.
	-	[x] Do not use fixed font-size units.
-	[x] Ensure the image fits the element correctly.
-	[x] Research and use a good standard reset.
	-	[x] See [CREATE A CSS RESET STYLESHEET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e0wuvhxLk4)
-	[ ] Test the final result on mobile device, both landscape and portrait.
-	[ ] Research and implement "landscapes".
