## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup

-   Javascript

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
    console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

-   TODO:
    -   [ ] Add responsiveness to the component for larger screens.
    -   [ ] Redevelop the javascript component of the solution manually, and repeat until comfortable.
    -   [x] Learn about CSS measurement units (CSS)
        -   [x] [Are you using the right CSS units?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wpD9Ov_To)
            -   Setting Font Sizes:
                -   Use the REM unit.
                -   REMs are relevant to the font size of the root element.
                -   Using REM units for fonts causes the fonts you specify with REMs to adapt to the user's system and browser preferences.
                -   The default font size of the root element is usually 16px.
                -   You can change this by setting the font-size on the html element to 62.5%, which changes the default font-size to 10px;
                -   You can then use `font-size: 2.1rem` to set the font size to 21px, `font-size: 1.6rem` to set it to 16px, etc (this makes the math simpler);
                -   Avoid using EMs for font-sizes.
            -   Setting widths:
                -   Best to use percentage.
                -   This can be coupled with a max-width.
                -   Viewport widths (VW) can also be used with caution (can cause issues).
                -   CH unit -> roughly equal to the width of the number 'o' on any given font.
                -   45ch is roughtly 45 characters wide.
            -   Setting heights:
                -   First, think about if you really need to set a height.
                -   If the height needs to be set, preferrably use a min-height instead of an absolute height.
                -   Then, use percentage, REM or VH - Viewport Height (may cause issues).
            -   Setting padding or margin:
                -   EM or REM.
            -   Media queries:
                -   Use EM (for consistency across all browsers).
            -   Pixels:
                -   Use them basically only when you need something really small.
                -   Otherwise avoid using pixels.
